 First, make sure that the file containing these functions is saved and has a .py extension.

2. In the file where you want to use these functions, you can import the entire module using the following line of code:

   `import si_calc`

   This assumes that the name of the file containing the functions is "function_library.py". If it has a different name, replace "function_library" with the actual name of the file.

3. Once you've imported the module, you can call any of the functions using the following syntax:

   `interest(p, r, t)`

   Replace "interest" with the name of the function you want to call

   For example, if you want to calculate the simple interest on a loan of $1000 at a rate of 5% for 2 years, you could use the following line of code:

   `interest(1000, 5, 2)`

   This would output the result of the calculation, which is $100.
